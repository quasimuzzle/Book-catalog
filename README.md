Three types of programs with the same functionality, written in the C++ programming language:
1) linear program using dynamic variables
2) linear program using pointers
3) modular program
   
The programs have a menu for selecting actions: adding a record, viewing all records, searching for a record by attribute, exit. The program defines a structure with at least five different attributes (string and numeric). Structures are written and stored in a binary file. The record search functionality must be implemented for each attribute: for string attributes – search by match; by numeric attributes – search by entered interval.


The linear type of program involves writing code without using its functions and procedures. The linear type of program using pointer type variables involves adding reference variables to the code (the structure variable - Struct - is declared as a reference in the program). With the modular type of programming, several auxiliary modules are connected to the main program module, which implement the functions of adding, outputting and searching for data.
